# Iteration Recipes

Recipes for iterating over, looping through, and repeating stuff:

1. [**Repeat Code a Specific Number of Times**](for.md): I want to repeatedly execute a chunk of code, counting the repetitions.

1. [**Repeat While or Until Something Is True**](while.md): I want to repeatedly execute a chunk of code while or until some condition is true, however many times that may be.

1. [**Stop Iteration Early**](break.md): Sometimes my code needs to stop iterating before a loop has reached its normal end (of the range in `for`, boolean termination condition in `while`).

1. [**Flip a Coin or Roll a Die**](pick.md): My code needs to randomly pick or decide something.

1. [**Determine Statistics of a Sequence**](stats.md): I want to determine some simple statistical measures (like frequency, mean, and standard deviation) of a set of measurements, events, or data, and I don't want to store all of the individual values in memory.

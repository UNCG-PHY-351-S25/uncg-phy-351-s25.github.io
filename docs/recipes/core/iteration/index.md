# Iteration Recipes

Recipes for iterating over, looping through, and repeating stuff:

1. [**Repeat Code a Specific Number of Times**](for.md): I want to repeatedly execute a chunk of code, counting the repetitions.

1. [**Repeat While or Until Something Is True**](while.md): I want to repeatedly execute a chunk of code while or until some condition is true, however many times that may be.

1. [**Skip One or All Remaining Iterations**](skip-iterations.md): I want my code to skip one iteration, or perhaps all remaining iterations, depending on some condition.

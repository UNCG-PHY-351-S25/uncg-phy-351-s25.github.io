## Recipe A: Jumping to the Next Iteration

Sometimes, in iterative code


### Variant D: Counting by Steps

The `range` function has a third optional argument that lets you specify the step size of the sequence. This can be used to count by twos, threes, or any other integer increment:

```python
for val in range(first_val, stop_before, step_size):
    # Anything in here will be executed repeatedly times with values of val
    # successively equal to first_val, first_val + step_size, 
    # first_val + 2 * step_size, ..., 
```
What will the last value be? That depends on how many multiples of the step size fit in before reaching the `stop_before` value. Python will continue iterating until adding another value of `step_size` would reach or exceed `stop_before`, and will then cease.

### Variant E: Counting Down

Counting downwards is as easy as specifying a negative step size, and choosing a larger starting value than the stopping value:

```python
for count in range(start_val, stop_before, -step_size):
    # Code here will execute repeatedly, with values of count starting at
    # start_val and decreasing by step_size each time, stopping just before
    # reaching or going past stop_before.
```

### Variant F: Counting by Non-Integer Steps

Alas, the `range()` function only works with integers. If you need to count by non-integer steps, you have
three options:

1. Count by integers, but multiply the counter variable by some fractional step size when you use it. This works if you want to count by regular steps that can be easily obtained from an integer sequence.

2. Use a `while` loop (coming in a recipe soon) and do all the initializing, incrementing, and endpoint-testing yourself. This is very flexible, but puts the work on you instead of on python, and can be more error-prone.

3. Use features similar to `range` from the `numpy` library, which we'll cover in a future unit. This will generally be your best bet, once you've learned that skillset.

## Examples

### Example 1: Uncounted Repetitions

Here's a function that creates a one-dimensional _fractal_ by repetition. It begins with the simple pattern `â–ˆ â–ˆ`. Every iteration, it replaces all `â–ˆ` characters with the initial pattern of `â–ˆ â–ˆ`, and replaces all space characters with a block of three spaces. Thus, in each iteration, the length of the string triples.

Imagine that instead of growing the length of the string, you're "zooming in" and seeing that each apparently-full cell actually has a hole in it. This is the essence of a _fractal_: Self-similarity at different scales.

```python
def fractal_string(depth):
    """ Generates a string of `X` and ` ` characters with a fractal density
        structure.
    """
    full_cell = 'â–ˆ â–ˆ'
    empty_cell = '   '
    s = full_cell
    for _ in range(depth):
        s = s.replace(' ', '~')
        s = s.replace('â–ˆ', full_cell)
        s = s.replace('~', empty_cell)
    return s
```

Copy-paste it into an IPython console (or script) and play with it! (It looks better if you go to a really small font size or zoom level, so that you can get more characters on one output line.)

### Example 2: Counting

If a biased coin lands on "heads" with probability $p$, the probability of obtaining $N$ heads in a row is $p^N$. Here's a function that displays the probability of increasingly long strings of heads:

```python
def heads_runs(p, n_max):
    """ Displays the probability of obtaining successively longer runs of
        "heads" with a biased coin whose probability of landing on "heads"
        in any given flip is `p`. `n_max` sets the longest run considered.
    """
    for n in range(1, n_max + 1):
        print(f"Probability of {n:2} heads in a row: {p**n:.2%}.")
```
(Note: I'm omitting the usual safety-checks on arguments so you can focus on the point of the recipe. In real code, I'd convert n_max to an integer and make sure both arguments had meaningful values.)

### Example 3: Countdown with changing interval

Want to write code for NASA Mission Control?

```python
import time
from IPython import get_ipython

def countdown(starting_time):
    """ Counts down in real-time, announcing every ten seconds until ten
        seconds are left, and then every second. If the starting time is
        greater than 10 s, it is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10
        seconds.
    """
    get_ipython().run_line_magic("clear", "")
    if (starting_time > 10) and (starting_time % 10 != 0):
        starting_time += 10 - starting_time % 10
    if starting_time >= 20:
        for t in range(starting_time, 10, -10):
            print(f"  Launch in T minus {t} seconds")
            time.sleep(10)
    print("  Launch in ", end="")
    for t in range(min(10, starting_time), 0, -1):
        print(f"{t}â€¦ ", end="")
        time.sleep(1)
    print("\nðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ BLASTOFF!!! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€")
```

### Example 4: Non-integer steps

For those of you taking special relativity in PHY 321: What are the values of gamma for speeds of 0, 0.05c, 0.1c, ..., c?

```python
from math import sqrt
def gamma():
    """ Display the values of the Lorentz factor "gamma" for velocities
        from zero up to 1 (in SR units), showing every increment of 0.1.
    """
    for d in range(0, 100, 5):
        v = d / 100
        gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v**2)
        print(f" v = {v:.2f} => gamma = {gamma:.5f}")
    print(f" v = {1:.2f} => gamma = infinite!")
```

## Recipe to Solve It

_This recipe is "procedural", meaning that it's a set of steps to follow rather than a particular bit of code to use. It has many steps, but don't be intimidated; it's pretty quick and easy once you get oriented._

**Prerequisites:**

1. A GitHub account with your UNCG username; 
2. An account on Beskar, Beatty's server.


### Part A: Fork the assignment on GitHub

_This part makes your own copy of the assignment, for you to work in and eventually submit._

1. **Log into GitHub** in a web browser, using your GitHub account. That should take you to your GitHub "dashboard" page.

2. **List your organizations** ("orgs") by clicking on your profile picture in the top-right corner, and selecting "Your organizations" from the dropdown menu that appears. That should take you to a page with a list of all GitHub orgs you belong to (which most likely has only one entry right now).

3. **Go to the `UNCG-PHY-351-S25` org** by clicking on it in the list. That should take you to the org's home page, with the rocket-and-atom logo next to the title "UNCG Physics 321 Spring 2025".

4. **Click on "Repositories"** in the menubar across the top of the page. That should take you to a page with a list of repositories. 

5. **Find the repository** ("repo") for the assignment you want to work on in the list of repositories. You may want to type part of its name into the search box at the top to filter the entries, change the sort order, switch to compact view, advance through multiple pages in the list, etc.

6. **Click on the repo name** for the assignment you want to work on. That should take you to the repo's home page.

7. **Read the README** below the list of repo files, in case it has any assignment-specific instructions that modify or add to this recipe.

8. **Click the "Fork" button** at the top right of the page. This should take you to a "Create a new fork" page.

9. **Change the Owner to `UNCG-PHY-351-S25`** in the "Owner" dropdown menu. (If you don't, Prof. Beatty won't be able to see your work, and therefore won't be able to offer feedback or award credit. That would suck.)

    > <span style="color: red;">**_Perhaps it's better to leave the owner as the individual student, and rely on pull requests for me to see and respond to work? That keeps the org repo list clean, and avoids the possibility of students deliberately or accidentally looking at each other's work._**</span>

### Part B: Clone it to Beskar

_This part makes a copy of the assignment repo on the server you'll do your actual coding work on._

1. Locate **the green "<> Code" button** at the top of the page, just above the top right corner of the file list. Click on it. That should produce a dropdown menu with a bunch of information in it.

2. In the dropdown, select the "Local" tab if it's not already selected. In the line that says "HTTPS SSH GitHub CLI", **select "GitHub CLI"**. The box right below where you click should now contain text that looks something like `gh repo clone UNCG-PHY-351-S25/L1.E`, where the last bit is the repo name.

3. **Click the copy button** (the two overlapping squares) to the right of this text box to copy the text snippet into your computer's clipboard.

4. Open a new web browser tab or window and, in it, [navigate to Beskar](http://beskar.uncg.edu).

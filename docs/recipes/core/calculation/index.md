# Calculation Recipes

Recipes for using python as a (powerful) calculator:

1. [**Calculate Interactively**](calc-interactively.md): I want to do a physics calculation that would be easy to do incorrectly in a calculator, and/or I might need to repeat it with different givens.
1. [**Use Python Functions**](use-functions.md): I want to use predefined mathematical (or other) functions, like sine or absolute-value, in my calculation.
1. [**Use Complex Numbers**](complex-numbers.md): I want to do a calculation that involves complex numbers.
1. [**Print Formatted Output**](print.md): I want to control the output of my code so that I can include text, specify precision, and so on.
1. [**Script a Calculation**](scripts.md): I want to make a multi-step calculation easier to construct and debug, run multiple times, run again later, and/or have a permanent record of.
1. [**Ask for User Input**](user-input.md): I want to be able to run my script (or let someone else run it) with various given values, without having to edit the script each time.

# Workflow Recipes

Recipes for doing basic, foundational python processes:

- **[Get, Do, Submit](get-do-submit.md)**: I want to get a PHY 351 assignment, work on it, and submit my work.
- **[Launch, Calc, Save](launch-calc-save.md)**: I want to use python to do a quick calculation that I probably wonâ€™t need to use again later.

# Log Into Beskar and JupyterLab
___

## Problem to Solve

> **I want to work on course assignments (or maybe apply what I'm learning to another course or project, or just noodle around with python).**
___

## Recipe

(This one is really quick and easy. It doesn't really deserve to be called a "recipe", but it's an important little step and I needed somewhere to put this information.)

### Part A: Log Into Beskar

1. Point your web browser to [https://beskar.uncg.edu/](https://beskar.uncg.edu/).

    - That should take you to a "sign in" page.

1. Enter your UNCG user ID for "Username".

1. Enter your Beskar passwordâ€¦

    - The very first time you do this, whatever you enter will become your Beskar password. So, choose it carefully, and **type it very carefully**.
    - You might consider using your UNCG password for this, too. That is at least guaranteed to be (1) hiqh-quality, and (2) something you'll remember.

1. Click the "Sign In" button.

That should take you to the main interface of JupyterLab, our coding environment.


### Part B: Welcome to JupyterLab

# Workflow Recipes

The "recipes" in this group are all "procedural", meaning that they consist of a set of steps to follow rather than a particular bit of code to use. Some must be followed precisely as stated, and others just illustrate tools and skills you can mix-and-match as needed.

Some of these recipes include one-time-only steps that you should only need to do once, or perhaps once every so often, mixed in with steps you'll do every time you follow the recipe. I'll try to be clear about which steps are once-only.

Overall, these recipes¬†‚Äî or rather, the process of applying and getting comfortable with them ‚Äî will familiarize you with key elements of the course "tech stack": the GitHub website and our course "org" within it; _Beskar_, the Linux server you'll use for all your coding work; _JupyterHub_, the browser-based coding environment that will be your "front door" and primary workbench on Beskar; and a bit of the behind-the-scenes plumbing on Beskar.

## The Recipes

Here are some recipes for basic processes required to use the course "tech stack" to get, do, and submit assignments. (It is very much **not an accident** that these same processes are widely useful in computational physics, and well beyond it into all kinds of software development work. üòè)

- **[Find and Fork a Repo on GitHub](find-and-fork.md)**: I want to make my own copy of a course level repo (the "package" that assignments come bundled in) so that I can start working on it.

- **[Log Into Beskar and JupyterLab](beskar-and-jlab.md)**: I want to work on course assignments (or maybe apply what I'm learning to another course or project, or just noodle around with python).

- **[Open and Use the System Terminal](system-terminal.md)**: I want to do something that must be done, or is easiest to do, directly with Beskar's operating system and filesystem ("behind the scenes") rather than in JupyterHub.

- **[Authenticate Your Beskar Account with GitHub](authenticate-to-github.md)**: I want to be able to copy course level (and other) repos from GitHub to Beskar without having to enter my GitHub username and password each time.

- **[Clone a Repo to Beskar](clone-to-beskar.md)**: I want to copy my fork of a course level repo from GitHub to Beskar so that I can start working on it in JupyterHub.

- **[Edit a File in an Assignment](edit-file.md)**: I want to make changes to the name or content of a file that came with a course level repo.

- **[Commit and Push Changes to GitHub](commit-push.md)**: I want to make a snapshot of my work so far in case I need to roll back changes, and copy the current repo state back to GitHub for safekeeping.

- **[Execute Interactive Python](interactive-python.md)**: I want to execute python commands interactively (perhaps to do a one-off calculation or just try things out).

- **[Submit a Level via Commit-Push-Pullreq](submit-level.md)**: I want to submit a repo (level) of completed work for course credit.

# Workflow Recipes

Recipes for doing basic, foundational python processes:

- **[Get an Assignment](get-assignment.md)**: I want to get a PHY 351 assignment so I can view and work on it.
- **[Launch, Calc, Save](launch-calc-save.md)**: I want to use python to do a quick calculation that I probably wonâ€™t need to use again later.
- **[Submit Work](submit-work.md)**: I want to submit completed work for credit.

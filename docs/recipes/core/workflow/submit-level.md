## Recipe 1: Submitting When Complete

1. Do one final commit-and-push of the repo, following the recipe [**_Commit and Push Changes to GitHub_**](commit-push.md).

1. **Go to GitHub** (probably in a different browser tab).

1. **Navigate to the main page of your fork of the repo**. You can click on the "Repositories" tab at the top of the page while in our GitHub org.
    - Near the top of that page, just above the list of files, you should see a message that says something like "This branch is X commits ahead of UNCG-PHY-351-S25:main.

1. **Click on the "Contribute" button** to the right of that message.
    - A dialog box should appear.

1. **Click the big green button "Open pull request" button**. That's your "submit" button!
    - That takes you to a form that gives you a chance to change the title of your pull request (submission) and add a message.

1. **Change the title to "Done and submitting"** (or whatever is appropriate).
    
1. **Add a comment in the "Leave a comment" box** if there's anything else you think I should know when I look at your submission.
    - If there's something in particular you'd like feedback on, this is a good place to say so.

1. **Click the green "Create pull request" button** at the bottom.

1. **Look for the green check by "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch"**. If you don't see it, let Prof. Beatty know ASAP. We'll figure it out.

That's it, you've submitted!

**If you realize you've submitted in error**, you can "un-submit" by scrolling to the bottom of that page — down below "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch" — and clicking the "Close pull request" button.
    - Before doing so, please put a note in the "Add a comment" section right above it saying what's going on, just to avoid confusion. _Thanks._

## Recipe 2: Resubmitting

If I kick your initial submission back for revision and you've then fixed whatever the problem was, you can resubmit by following the same steps as above. However,

- Please use a title like "Resubmitting fixed version".
- Add a comment in the "Leave a comment" box explaining what you fixed, or anything else that might help me not be confused. _Thanks._

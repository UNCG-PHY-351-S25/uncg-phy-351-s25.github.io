### Part B: Clone it to Beskar

_This part makes a copy of the assignment repo on the server you'll do your actual coding work on._

1. Locate **the green "<> Code" button** at the top of the page, just above the top right corner of the file list. Click on it. That should produce a dropdown menu with a bunch of information in it.

2. In the dropdown, select the "Local" tab if it's not already selected. In the line that says "HTTPS SSH GitHub CLI", **select "GitHub CLI"**. The box right below where you click should now contain text that looks something like `gh repo clone UNCG-PHY-351-S25/L1.E`, where the last bit is the repo name.

3. **Click the copy button** (the two overlapping squares) to the right of this text box to copy the text snippet into your computer's clipboard.

4. Open a new web browser tab or window and, in it, [navigate to Beskar](http://beskar.uncg.edu).

5. TBCâ€¦

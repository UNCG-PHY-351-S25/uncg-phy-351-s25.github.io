# Function Recipes

Recipes for writing and using your own functions:

1. [**Write Your Own Function**](writing-functions.md): I want to easily reuse a particular calculation multiple times, with different givens.

1. [**Make Arguments Optional**](optional-args.md): I want my code to decide what to do based on the circumstances.

1. [**Execute Conditionally**](conditionals.md): I want my code to decide what to do based on the circumstances.

1. [**Safety-Check Arguments**](safety-check.md): I want to make my function robust against incorrect or unexpected arguments.

1. [**Factor Out Subfunctions**](factoring.md): I want to break a complicated calculation into pieces to keep it manageable.

1. [**Use Global Variables (Sparingly!)**](globals.md): I need to get values deep into a function or subfunction, and passing them via arguments is tedious.

1. [**Run or Import From a Script**](run-or-import.md): I want to write a script that I can run, and I also want to use functions it defines in the console or other scripts.

# Creating your GitHub Account

For this course, you'll need a GitHub account tied to your UNCG email address. If you happen to have one already — from a CS course, perhaps — great. (You'll still need to do the final step below, though.) If not, here's how to create one.

### Part A: Create the GitHub Account

1. In a web browser, open [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) in a new browser tab or window.

1. The page you land on should have a prominent "Sign up for GitHub" button next to a blank for your email address. Enter your **UNCG** email address and click.

1. Follow the account creation steps (email authentication, etc.).

    * IMPORTANT: When prompted for "Username", choose your UNCG user ID: The portion of your UNCG email address before the "@" symbol.
    
    * Pick your password carefully, as you'll need to use it frequently. (May I suggest getting and learning to use a good password management program? I use _1Password_.)

    * At the appropriate step, identify yourself as a "student". Choose the free student plan.

1. When you get to the page with "The home for all developers — including you" at the top, you've succeeded!


### Part B: Get Added to the Course "Org"

1. Now that you've created your GitHub account, tell Prof. Beatty. He'll add you to the course GitHub org.

1. Wait… ⏳⌛️… (hopefully not long!)… until…

1. Prof. Beatty lets you know that you've been added.
    - You can check or verify by going to GitHub, clicking on your user icon in the far upper right, and selecting "Your organizations". You should see "UNCG-PHY-351-S25" listed there.

## Thereafter…

Once you've been added to the org, you can go directly to the org's GitHub page via

- [https://github.com/UNCG-PHY-351-S25](https://github.com/UNCG-PHY-351-S25)

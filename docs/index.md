## Recipes

This compendium of computational physics "recipes" is the primary reference material of the PHY 351 course. Rather than reading it straight through, as you might a traditional textbook, let the course assignments guide you. The various _exercises_ each specify one recipe that you are to try for yourself; that is a good time to read the recipe in detail. You'll probably want to refer back to prior recipes at least occasionally, until you've internalized them.

## Topics

This section of the website contains a grab-bag of miscellaneous general reference information, tips about using python, and links to helpful outside resources. Some of the recipes link to specific topics here for further detail.
